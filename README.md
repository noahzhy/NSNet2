# NSNet2

This is an Unofficial PyTorch implementation of the paper "NSNet2: Data augmentation and loss normalization for deep noise suppression" (https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.06412).

The model is based on the NSNet2 baseline model from the [DNS-Challenge](https://github.com/microsoft/DNS-Challenge).
The pipeline is based on the paper "Towards efficient models for real-time deep noise suppression" (https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.09249).

## Description

The `model/nsnet2` model structure is same as the original model.
The `model/nsnet2_ex` model is a modified version of the original model. Includes the preprocessing and postprocessing steps in the model, but excludes the FFT and IFFT processes.

In addition, the `model/tinySenet` model is a modified version of the original model. The model is implemented with a small number of parameters via tensorflow. Replace the original model GRU with a FastGRNN cell. The quantized tf-lite model get 0.067 ms inference time on Apple M2 chip.

## Inference Time
